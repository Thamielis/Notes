The combination of VMware® infrastructure and NetApp® MetroCluster™ resolves a number of customer disaster recovery challenges from both the server and storage perspectives. VMware infrastructure provides a robust server consolidation solution with high application availability. MetroCluster provides continuously available storage with access to your data whether it is between racks or availability zones in a data center, across a campus, or separate data centers in a metro area. Your data and applications stay online in mirrored clusters.

In this lab, you demonstrate MetroCluster operation, including site switchover and switchback, and identify NetApp best practices for a VMware vSphere stretched cluster on NetApp MetroCluster.

You explore how Active IQ Unified Manager monitors MetroCluster clusters. Then you demonstrate using SnapMirror (SVM DR) to replicate a disaster recovery copy of a Storage VM with it's configuration and data to a third cluster.

Warnings:

Due to the configuration of this lab environment, the virtual machines containing the ONTAP clusters cannot be powered off and cannot demonstrate an unplanned switchover.
