Note: Replace placeholders (in curly braces) with actual values for your script.

  

  

Overview

  

  

This section provides a high-level overview of the script, including its purpose and requirements. It’s good practice to include basic metadata (script name, description, author, version, etc.) at the top of the script for consistency . Also note any prerequisites needed to run the script (e.g. required PowerShell version, modules, or system requirements) .

  

-   Script Name: {Script Name}
-   Description: {Brief description of what the script does}
-   Author: {Author Name}
-   Version: {Version (e.g., 1.0.0)}
-   Last Modified: {Date of last update}
-   Prerequisites:  
    

-   {Any prerequisites, e.g. PowerShell 7.0+, required software, permissions, etc.}

-     
    

  

  

  

Dependencies

  

  

List all modules or scripts that this script depends on, categorized by type:

  

-   Built-in Modules/Cmdlets:  
    

-   {Built-in module/cmdlet name} – {optional description/purpose}
-   (Include any PowerShell modules/cmdlets that come with PowerShell and are crucial to this script’s functionality).

-     
    
-   Third-Party Modules:  
    

-   {Module Name (Version)} – {description of use in script}
-   (Modules from PSGallery or other sources that need to be installed for this script. Include version numbers if applicable.)

-     
    
-   Custom Scripts/Modules:  
    

-   {Path\To\Dependency.ps1} – {Description of what this script/module provides}
-   (Any custom script or module (with relative path) that is required. Describe its purpose.)

-     
    

  

  

  

Defined Functions

  

  

Below is a list of functions defined within {Script Name}, along with their purpose, parameters, and relationships. Each function is documented to clarify its role in the script’s logic.

  

  

Function: 

FunctionName1

  

  

Purpose: {What does FunctionName1 do?}

Parameters:

  

-   Param1 (Type) – Description of this parameter.
-   Param2 (Type) – Description of this parameter.  
    (Add all parameters the function accepts, with types and meanings.)

  

  

Returns: {Description of the data or object returned by FunctionName1 (if any).}

Calls: {List of other functions this function calls, if any – e.g., FunctionName2, HelperFunctionX – with links as appropriate.}

Called From: {Where this function is invoked – e.g., “Called by FunctionNameA” or “Called in the main script execution flow” – with links if appropriate.}

  

Example:

# Example usage of FunctionName1

FunctionName1 -Param1 <value1> -Param2 <value2>

  

Function: 

FunctionName2

  

  

Purpose: {Purpose of FunctionName2.}

Parameters:

  

-   ParamA (Type) – Description.
-   ParamB (Type) – Description.

  

  

Returns: {Description of return value.}

Calls: {Other functions or scripts called by FunctionName2, if any.}

Called From: {Where/by whom FunctionName2 is called.}

  

Example:

# Example usage of FunctionName2

FunctionName2 -ParamA <valueA> -ParamB <valueB>

(Repeat the above subsections for each function defined in the script, ensuring each function’s name is a link target for the call flow section.)

  

  

Call Flow Overview

  

  

This section outlines the high-level execution flow of the script, showing which functions call others in sequence. The call hierarchy below uses nested bullets to represent the call stack. (Click the function names to jump to their documentation above.)

  

-   Start – Script execution begins  
    

-   FunctionName1 – {Brief purpose of FunctionName1 in context}  
    

-   FunctionName2 – {Brief purpose, called by FunctionName1}  
    

-   FunctionName3 – {Brief purpose, called by FunctionName2}

-     
    

-     
    
-   FunctionName4 – {Brief purpose of FunctionName4, called after FunctionName1}
-   (Continue this nested list for all major function calls in their execution order.)

-     
    
-   End – Script execution ends

  

  

  

Error Handling

  

  

Document how the script and its functions handle errors or exceptions. Describe any try/catch logic, validations, or fallback mechanisms implemented in the code. (Using PowerShell’s try {...} catch {...} blocks to handle terminating errors is recommended for robust scripts .) For example:

  

-   FunctionName2 – Enclosed in a try/catch to handle any errors during {operation}, and logs errors to {LogFile} if an exception occurs. Non-terminating errors from cmdlets are converted to exceptions with -ErrorAction Stop to ensure they are caught.
-   FunctionName4 – Uses parameter validation (e.g., ValidateRange, ValidateSet) to catch invalid input before proceeding.
-   Global – The script sets $ErrorActionPreference to Stop (or uses $ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue' with selective try/catch) so that errors are either handled or bubble up. A trap or final catch in the main script block ensures any uncaught exceptions are reported.
-   (Include any other error-handling details, such as cleaning up resources in a finally block, or if the script uses -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue for expected errors.)

  

  

  

Output Artifacts

  

  

Describe any output this script generates, whether files, logs, or console output:

  

-   Logs: {Description of log files created, e.g., “A transcript log is saved to <ScriptName>.log in the script directory containing all output.”}
-   Output Files: {Any files created or modified, e.g., “Generates Report.csv with summary of results in the output folder.”}
-   Console Output: {What the script prints to the console, e.g., “Progress and summary messages are written to the host.”}
-   Output Objects: {Any PowerShell objects or data structures output to the pipeline (if applicable), e.g., “Outputs an array of user objects on success.”}

  

  

  

Usage Examples and Notes

  

  

This section provides examples of how to run the script and important notes about its usage.

  

Usage Example:

# Basic usage example

.\{Script Name}.ps1 -Param1 <value1> -Param2 <value2>  

(Describe what the above example does, if not obvious. Provide additional examples for different scenarios or parameter combinations if helpful.)

  

Edge Cases / Known Limitations:

  

-   {Mention any known edge case behaviors or limitations. For example, “This script assumes an internet connection and will timeout after 30 seconds if not available.”}
-   {E.g., “Runs only on Windows platforms – will not work on Linux PowerShell.”}
-   {E.g., “If the input list exceeds 1000 items, performance may degrade.”}

  

  

(It’s important to highlight any limitations or special conditions for the script so users aren’t caught by surprise. For instance, if the script must run on a local machine (not remote), or requires elevated privileges, note that here.)

  

Additional Notes:

  

-   {Any additional usage notes, such as configuration steps needed, environmental setup, or references to external documentation. For example, “Ensure AWS CLI is configured before running this script,” or “This script uses XYZ API – see the API docs for rate limits.”}
-   {Any suggestions for future improvements or to-do items (if this is an internal document), marked clearly if needed.}
