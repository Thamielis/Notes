  "Synopsis": "Identifies files with duplicate content and uses a partial hash for large files to speed calculation up",
  "Description": "Returns a hashtable with the hashes that have at least two files (duplicates). Large files with partial hashes are suffixed with a \"P\".\nLarge files with a partial hash can be falsely positive: they may in fact be different even though the partial hash is the same\nYou either need to calculate the full hash for these files to be absolutely sure, or add -TestPartialHash.\nCalculating a full hash for large files may take a very long time though. So you may be better off using other\nstrategies to identify duplicate file content, i.e. look at identical creation times, etc.",
