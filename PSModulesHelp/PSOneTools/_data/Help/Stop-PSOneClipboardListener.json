  "Synopsis": "Stops the clipboard monitor and ends the background thread.",
  "Description": "As long as the clipboard monitor is running in the background, any valid PowerShell code that is copied to the clipboard opens a new editor pane.\nSo it is important to stop the clipboard monitor when it is not useful anymore. \nMake sure you stop the clipboard monitor before you close the ISE. If the background thread continues to run, the ISE window may close but the ISE process may still run.",
