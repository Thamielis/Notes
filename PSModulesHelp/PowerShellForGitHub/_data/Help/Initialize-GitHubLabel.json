    "This method does not rename any existing labels, as it doesn't have any context regarding\nwhich Label the new name is for.  Therefore, it is possible that by running this function\non a repository with Issues that have already been assigned Labels, you may experience data\nloss as a minor correction to you (maybe fixing a typo) will result in the old Label being\nremoved (and thus unassigned from existing Issues) and then the new one created."
