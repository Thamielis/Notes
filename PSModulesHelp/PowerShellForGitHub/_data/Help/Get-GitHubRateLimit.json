    "GitHub.RateLimit\nLimits returned are _per hour_.\n\nThe Search API has a custom rate limit, separate from the rate limit\ngoverning the rest of the REST API. The GraphQL API also has a custom\nrate limit that is separate from and calculated differently than rate\nlimits in the REST API.\n\nFor these reasons, the Rate Limit API response categorizes your rate limit.\nUnder resources, you'll see three objects:\n\nThe core object provides your rate limit status for all non-search-related resources\nin the REST API.\nThe search object provides your rate limit status for the Search API.\nThe graphql object provides your rate limit status for the GraphQL API.\n\nDeprecation notice\nThe rate object is deprecated.\nIf you're writing new API client code or updating existing code,\nyou should use the core object instead of the rate object.\nThe core object contains the same information that is present in the rate object."
