  "Synopsis": "Transfer a repository",
  "Description": "A transfer request will need to be accepted by the new owner when transferring a personal repository to another user.\nThe response will contain the original `owner`, and the transfer will continue asynchronously. For more details on\nthe requirements to transfer personal and organization-owned repositories, see\n[about repository transfers](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-repository-transfers/).\nYou must use a personal access token (classic) or an OAuth token for this endpoint. An installation access token or\na fine-grained personal access token cannot be used because they are only granted access to a single account.",
