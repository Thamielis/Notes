  "Synopsis": "Enter a new runspace within a process hosted by the PowerShell Editor Services Integrated Console.",
  "Description": "The Enter-EditorServicesProcess function creates a new runspace within the integrated console. In this runspace you can interact with Editor Services from a standard PowerShell console.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe runspace will not be the same one the integrated console uses, but it will have a functioning $psEditor variable and contain all the same loaded assemblies.  You can also use the \"Get-Runspace\" and \"Debug-Runspace\" cmdlets to interact with the default runspace currently active in the integrated console.",
