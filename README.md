## Cross-reference links

Cross-reference links are a special feature supported by the publishing system. You can use cross-reference links in conceptual articles to link to .NET API or cmdlet reference.

For links to .NET API reference, see in the central Contributor Guide.

Links to cmdlet reference have the following format: xref:<module-name>.<cmdlet-name>. For example, to link to the Get-Content cmdlet in the Microsoft.PowerShell.Management module.

[Get-Content](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Management.Get-Content)

## Deep linking

Deep linking is allowed on both URL and file links.

The anchor text must be lowercase
Add the anchor to the end of the target path. For example:
[about_Splatting](about_Splatting.md#splatting-with-arrays)
[custom key bindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_custom-keybindings-for-refactorings)
For more information, see [Documentation](docs/README.md)
