**Why it is so cool?**  
If you wrote some PowerShell scripts in your life you know that sometimes is hard to find proper command for your needs.  
Now you don’t need to search google in order to find proper solution for you, everything what you need is in one place!  
Of course for now not all modules are available but if you are working with Azure for sure you can find proper command for you.

Below packages which are currently available in Powershell module browser:  
– **Powershell** – standard powershell module available on all Windows system  
– **AzureRM** – Azure module for Resource Manager  
– **Azure Service Management** – module for old Azure portal resources – Service management

Module browser gives also possibility to check commands in specific version of package.  
Standard Powershell module shows versions from 3.0 , as lower version can cause many of issues when they will be run in versions higher than 2.0.
