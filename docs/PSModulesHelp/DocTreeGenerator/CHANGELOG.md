## Next Release

## 2.0.09 (August 5, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:
  - Added new templates provided by ebekker:
    + bootstrap4 template for a clean, modern look
	+ test template to visualize the components that are defined by the template engine; also useful in developing and debugging templates

  - Improved user experience when:
    + no namespaces resolved out of glob pattern supplied on command line
    + no modules found within a namespace
    + no functions found within a module
    + module unable to load

BUG FIXES:
  - [Issue #11](https://github.com/msorens/DocTreeGenerator/issues/11): Wildcard in Namespace selector should be resolved before using for page title
  - [Issue #10](https://github.com/msorens/DocTreeGenerator/issues/10): Hyperlinks not being generated for custom functions from other local modules
  - [Issue #7](https://github.com/msorens/DocTreeGenerator/issues/7): Cannot locate functions when module defines a DefaultCommandPrefix


## 2.0.08 (June 10, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:
  - Updated module manifest to latest PS5 template (from New-ModuleManifest)
  - Centralized exported functions list to manifest for PSGallery compatibility
  - Filled in manifest to support release to PSGallery


## 2.0.07 (December 22, 2016)

IMPROVEMENTS:
  - Added Publish-ModuleDocumentationTree for more easily automating
    documentation generation for several modules under a single namespace.
  - Added Copy-Module cmdlet to support above.


## 2.0.06 (June 14, 2016)

IMPROVEMENTS:
  - Report more specific errors when no namespaces are found.
  - [Issue #4](https://github.com/msorens/DocTreeGenerator/issues/4): Added -SourceDir parameter to allow  modules located in an arbitrary directory.


BUG FIXES:
  - If custom function listed as a related link was not found, it previously
    generated an invalid URL on the hyperlink for it.
	Changed to just emit the custom function name as plain text.


## 2.0.05 (April 19, 2016)

IMPROVEMENTS:
  - Report more specific errors when problems with an overview file are encountered.
  - Added template and script for regenerating self-documentation (i.e. DocTreeGenerator itself).

BUG FIXES:
  - [Issue #3](https://github.com/msorens/DocTreeGenerator/issues/3): Overview files were not returning valid results with a DocType definition (DTD) present.



## 2.0.04 (March 1, 2016)

IMPROVEMENTS:
  - In conjunction with fixing multi-line code examples (below),
    changed list items (beginning with plus, minus, asterisk) to still
	emit a <br> before the line but removed emitting one after the line.
  - Also for code examples, added emitting a <br> before a canonical
    PowerShell prompt (PS>).

BUG FIXES:
  - Module properties used in template might appear with multiple values
    if module being documented was already loaded in the PowerShell host.
  - Code examples with more than one line of code had several HTML generation
    issues.

  - Correct rendering of HTML-special characters in syntax section.
  - Resynced link to DocTreeGenerator in template to new GitHub location.
  - Resynced template path after file reorganization.



## 2.0.01 (December 21, 2015)

    > recognize lists and add line breaks
	> recognize headers and add line breaks and apply style tag.
	> recognize code segments and apply style tag.
	> flow and wrap body text for description and for parameters.
  - Add unit tests.
  - Update license.
