The Where-Object cmdlet filters the network adapters that have a link speed of 100 Mbps, and then passes the network NetAdapter object to the Remove-NetNeighbor cmdlet. The Remove-NetNeighbor cmdlet  removes all neighbor cache entries that have IPv4 addresses and are associated with a network adapter that has a link speed of 100 Mbps."
