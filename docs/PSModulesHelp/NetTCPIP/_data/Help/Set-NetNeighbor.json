  "Synopsis": "Modifies a neighbor cache entry.",
  "Description": "The Set-NetNeighbor cmdlet modifies a neighbor cache entry. The neighbor cache maintains information for each on-link neighbor, including the IP address and the associated link-layer address. You can modify only neighbor cache entries that are in a permanent state on interfaces that have link-layer addresses. Use this cmdlet to modify the link-layer address and policy store setting of a neighbor cache entry.",
