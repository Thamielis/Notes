  "Description": "Lists the teams that have access to the specified repository and that are also visible to the authenticated user.\n\nFor a public repository, a team is listed only if that team added the public repository explicitly.\n\nPersonal access tokens require the following scopes:\n* `public_repo` to call this endpoint on a public repository\n* `repo` to call this endpoint on a private repository (this scope also includes public repositories)\n\nThis endpoint is not compatible with fine-grained personal access tokens.",
