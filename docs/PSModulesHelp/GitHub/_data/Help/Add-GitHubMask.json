  "Synopsis": "Masks a value in a log",
  "Description": "Masking a value prevents a string or variable from being printed in the log. Each masked word separated by whitespace is\nreplaced with the * character. You can use an environment variable or string for the mask's value. When you mask a value,\nit is treated as a secret and will be redacted on the runner. For example, after you mask a value, you won't be able to\nset that value as an output.",
