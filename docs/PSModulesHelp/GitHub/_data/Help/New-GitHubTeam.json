For more information, see\n\"[Setting team creation permissions](https://docs.github.com/articles/setting-team-creation-permissions-in-your-organization).\"\n\nWhen you create a new team, you automatically become a team maintainer without explicitly adding yourself to the optional array of\n`maintainers`.
