  "Synopsis": "Merges two Worksheets (or other objects) into a single Worksheet with differences marked up.",
  "Description": "The Compare-Worksheet command takes two Worksheets and marks differences in the source document, and optionally outputs a grid showing the changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy contrast the Merge-Worksheet command takes the Worksheets and combines them into a single sheet showing the old and new data side by side. Although it is designed to work with Excel data it can work with arrays of any kind of object; so it can be a merge of Worksheets, or a merge to a Worksheet.",

Because no \"Key\" property is given, \"Name\" is assumed to be the key and the only other property examined is length.
