  "Synopsis": "Measures command performance with consecutive tests.",
  "Description": "This function measures the performance of a scriptblock many consective times.\n\nWarning: Running a command repeatedly may not yield reliable information, since repeated executions may benefit from caching or other performance enhancing features, depending on the script content.\nThis is best suited for measuring the performance of tasks that will later be run repeatedly as well.\nIt also is useful for mitigating local performance fluctuations when comparing performances.",
