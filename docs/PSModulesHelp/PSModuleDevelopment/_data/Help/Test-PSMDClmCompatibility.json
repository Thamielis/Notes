  "Description": "Tests, whether the targeted file would have trouble executing under Constrained Language Mode (CLM).\n\nIn CLM, various language features and commands are constrained in their ability to execute.\nThis command uses the AST parser to scan for as many known issues as possible and gives a comprehensive report for concerns found.\n\nDetected Issues:\n- Custom Object creation using PSCustomObject\n- Calling methods on untrusted types\n- Converting to an untrusted type\n- Using Add-Type to load anything but trusted libraries\n- Using New-Object to instantiate an untrusted type\n- Assigning Values to properties*\n\n*This detection will likely have a large rate of false positives, due to inability to detect datatype of the object, the property of which is being set.\nGenerally, assigning values to the properties of PSObjects is fine.\n\nNote:\nMany of the detections make allowances for \"whitelisted types\".\nIn CLM, access to most types is constrained, except for a few, known to be trustworthy types.\nTo get a full list of the constraints and what types are allowed, see the documentation:\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_language_modes?view=powershell-7.1#constrained-language-constrained-language",
