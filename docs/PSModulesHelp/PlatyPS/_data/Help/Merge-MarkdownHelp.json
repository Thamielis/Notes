  "Synopsis": "Merge multiple markdown versions of the same cmdlet into a single markdown file.",
  "Description": "Similar modules, or different versions of the same module, often contain duplicate content.\r\n\r\n\r\nMerge-MarkdownHelp merges the multiple markdown files into a single markdown file. It uses the `applicable:` yaml metadata field to identify what versions or tags are applicable. It acts on two levels: for the whole cmdlet and for individual parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resulting markdown contains the `applicable:` tags as well as all of the content of the original markdown files. Duplicate content is simply ignored. Content that is unique to each file is merged using merge markers , followed by a comma-separated list of applicable tags. A merge marker is a string of text that acts as a marker to describe the content that was merged. The default merge marker text consists of three exclamation points !!! however this can be changed to any relevant text using the -MergeMarker flag.",
