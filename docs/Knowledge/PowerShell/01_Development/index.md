## [1. Declarative DevOps Microframeworks](Knowledge/PowerShell/01_Development/Declarative%20DevOps%20Microframeworks.md)
> Declarative DevOps Microframeworks is the most robust, portable, and scalable pattern for managing your DevOps systems. This series will help you understand the concepts behind Declarative DevOps Microframeworks, then walk you through implementing some common use cases in the most DevOps-friendly language: PowerShell.

### [1.1. Functional Programming in PowerShell](Knowledge/PowerShell/01_Development/01_Functional%20Programming%20in%20PowerShell.md)
> Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. In this section, we will explore how to leverage functional programming concepts in PowerShell to create more robust and maintainable scripts.

### [1.2. Declarative DevOps](Knowledge/PowerShell/01_Development/02_Declarative%20DevOps.md)
> Declarative DevOps is a methodology that emphasizes the use of declarative languages and tools to define and manage infrastructure and applications. This section will cover the principles of declarative DevOps, including the use of configuration management tools, infrastructure as code, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

### [1.3. DevoOps Microframewrks](Knowledge/PowerShell/01_Development/03_Declarative%20DevOps%20Microframeworks.md)
> DevOps Microframeworks are lightweight frameworks that provide a set of tools and best practices for implementing DevOps principles in a specific context. This section will explore the concept of microframeworks, their benefits, and how to create and use them effectively in your DevOps processes.

### [1.4. Private PowerShell Modules](Knowledge/PowerShell/01_Development/04_Private%20PowerShell%20Modules.md)
> Private PowerShell modules are custom modules that are not intended for public distribution. This section will cover the best practices for creating, managing, and using private PowerShell modules, including versioning, documentation, and testing.

### [1.5. Writing Maintainable PowerShell](Knowledge/PowerShell/01_Development/05_Writing%20Maintainable%20PowerShell.md)
> Writing maintainable PowerShell code is essential for ensuring the long-term success of your scripts and modules. This section will cover best practices for writing clean, readable, and maintainable PowerShell code, including naming conventions, code organization, and documentation.

### [1.6. Declarative Config Management](Knowledge/PowerShell/01_Development/06_Declarative%20Config%20Management.md)
> Declarative configuration management is a method of managing system configurations using declarative languages and tools. This section will explore the principles of declarative configuration management, including the use of tools like DSC (Desired State Configuration) and Ansible, and how to implement them in PowerShell.

### [1.7. Declarative Idempotency](Knowledge/PowerShell/01_Development/07_Declarative%20Idempotency.md)
> Declarative idempotency is a key principle in DevOps that ensures that applying the same configuration multiple times will not change the system's state beyond the initial application. This section will cover the concept of idempotency, its importance in DevOps, and how to implement it in PowerShell scripts and modules.

### [1.8. Automating Work-Item Management](Knowledge/PowerShell/01_Development/08_Automating%20Work-Item%20Management.md)
> Automating work-item management is a crucial aspect of DevOps that helps streamline the process of tracking and managing work items. This section will cover best practices for automating work-item management using PowerShell, including integration with tools like Azure DevOps and Jira, and how to create custom scripts for managing work items effectively.
