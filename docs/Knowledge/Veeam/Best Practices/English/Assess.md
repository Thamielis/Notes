Before we can start designing and building a Veeam infrastructure, we need to know some variables and metrics about the infrastructure we need to protect. To process your data in a certain amount of time, compute resources are needed. To store several copies of the data storage, capacity is needed somewhere and preferable in multiple locations.

The information needed to define a proper data protection strategy is just partly technical and that part can be inventoried with a wide variety of tools. The other part is the functional requirement which needs to be defined by the data- and business owners.
