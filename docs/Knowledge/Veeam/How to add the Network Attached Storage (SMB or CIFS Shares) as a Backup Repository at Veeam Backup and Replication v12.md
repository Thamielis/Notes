# How to add the Network Attached Storage (SMB or CIFS Shares) as a Backup Repository at Veeam Backup and Replication v12
![How to add the Network Attached Storage (SMB or CIFS Shares) as a Backup Repository at Veeam Backup and Replication v12](https://i0.wp.com/www.checkyourlogs.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/082523_1816_Howtoaddthe4.png?resize=916%2C640&quality=80&ssl=1)

You can use network-attached storage (SMB or CIFS Shares) as backup repositories with Veeam Backup and Replication. A network-attached storage (NAS) device can be a shared folder on your computer or any other physical device accessed via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.  

Note:  

-   You must deploy a gateway server because an SMB share cannot host Veeam Data Movers. Veeam Backup & Replication will automatically deploy a Veeam Data Mover on this gateway server.  
    
-   It is recommended that you deploy an additional gateway server in the remote site, closer to the SMB repository, if you plan to move VM data to an off-site SMB repository over a WAN link.  
    

1. Log in to the Veeam Backup and replication manager server.

2. Open the Veeam Backup & Replication Console and click Connect.
