Please analyze the following PowerShell script and its related files to generate comprehensive documentation in the extended format we discussed. The goal is to extract:

- Script metadata (name, description, version, author, last modified, prerequisites)
- Dependency list (built-in, third-party, custom)
- Defined functions with:
  - Purpose
  - Parameters and their types/descriptions
  - Return values
  - Functions it calls (with linkable structure)
  - Functions that call it
  - Example usage if possible
- A high-level call sequence with nesting
- Error handling techniques
- Output artifacts (logs, files, objects)
- Usage examples, edge cases, and known limitations

**Files provided:**
- Main script: `Script.ps1`
- Related modules: `./modules/ModuleA.psm1`, `./modules/ModuleB.psm1`
- Related scripts: `./functions/Helper1.ps1`, `./functions/Helper2.ps1`

**Instructions:**
- Format your response using Markdown and make use of anchor links for functions.
- Use collapsible sections if needed to enhance readability.
- Include summaries where beneficial.
- Be neutral and descriptive â€” the documentation is for future developers and maintainers.

Let me know if you need all the files in one batch or one by one.
